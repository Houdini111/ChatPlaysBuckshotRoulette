#Requirements

To run this program you must have Python3 installed (which can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the following python dependencies

1. pillow (Python Image Library)
2. pyautogui
3. getpixelcolor
4. TwitchIO
5. AioHttp
6. Aynscio

You can install these dependencies, after python is installed, by running `install.bat` which will also prompt you to choose your Tesseract-OCR file location if it doesn't find it in the default location.

Once those are done you can start the bot by running `start.bat`
