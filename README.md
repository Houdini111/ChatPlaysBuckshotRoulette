#Requirements

To run this program you must have Tesseract-OCR installed. The latested installer can be found  on this page https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki.
You will also need to have Python3 installed (which can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the following python dependencies

1. pillow (Python Image Library)
2. pyautogui
3. pytesseract
4. numpy
5. opencv-python
6. getpixelcolor

You can install these dependencies, after python is installed, by running `install.bat` which will also prompt you to choose your Tesseract-OCR file location if it doesn't find it in the default location.

Once those are done you can start the bot by running `start.bat`
