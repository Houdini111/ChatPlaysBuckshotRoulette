#Requirements

To run this program you must have Python3 installed and the following python dependencies

1. pillow (Python Image Library)
2. pyautogui
3. pytesseract
4. numpy
5. opencv-python
6. getpixelcolor

You can install these, after python, by running `install.bat` which will also prompt you to choose your Tesseract-OCR file location, if it doesn't find it in the default location.

Once those are done you can start the bot by running `start.bat`
